        <h style="color:blue;"> <strong> coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19)</strong> </h>is a contagious syndrome
        coronavirus2(SARS-COV-2).The first known case was
        identified in<h style="color: blue;"><strong> Wahan,chain,</strong> </h>in December
        2019.the disease has since spread worldwide,leading to<h style="color: blue"> ongoing pandemic.</h>symptoms of
        COVID-19 are variable ,but
        often include fever,cough,headache,
        <h style="color: blue"> breathing difficulties</h>,and loss of smell and taste. symptoms may be begin one to
        fourteen days after exposure to
        the virus.At least a third of people
        who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms.of those people who develop symptoms noticeable enough to be
        classed as patients,most (81%) develop
        mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia),while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea,hypoxia,or more than
        50% lung involvement on imaging),and
        5% suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure,shock,or multiorgan dysfunction). Older people are at a higher
        risk of developing severe symptoms.Some
        people continue to experience a range of effects (long COVID) for months after recovery,and damage to organs has
        been observed. Multi-year studies are
        underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease.
